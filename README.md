This is our implementation for the following papers:

**Pan Li, and Alexander Tuzhilin. "Latent Modeling of Unexpectedness for Recommendations." Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (Late-Breaking Results). 2019.** [[Paper]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2431/paper8.pdf)

**Pan Li. "Hybrid Utility Function for Unexpected Recommendations." Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (Doctoral Consortium). 2020.** [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3336191.3372183)

**Pan Li, and Alexander Tuzhilin. "Latent Unexpected and Useful Recommendation." arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.01546 (2019).** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01546)

We provide the sample dataset as a showcase. You are always welcome to use our codes for your own dataset.

**Please cite our RecSys'19 and WSDM 20' paper if you use our codes. Thanks!**
